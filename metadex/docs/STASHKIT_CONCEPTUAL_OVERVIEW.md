# StashKit: A Conceptual Overview

StashKit transforms messy, partial, real-world data into clean, structured,
domain-aware knowledge stored in a StashDex.

MetaDex encodes:

- The core architectural entities (StashKit, StashDex, Resolvers, Skills, BoosterPacks, Barback)
- Their relationships
- High-level API surfaces
- Normalized, ML-friendly values

The normalization pass ensures that small YAML formatting differences do not
change the semantic shape of the compiled JSON.
