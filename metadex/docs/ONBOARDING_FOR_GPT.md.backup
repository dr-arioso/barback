# Using MetaDex with GPT

1. Ensure PyYAML is installed in your environment:

   pip install pyyaml

2. From the repo root, run the compiler to generate a fresh `metadex.json`:

   python compiler/compiler.py \
       --source source_yaml \
       --output metadex/metadex.json

3. Upload `metadex/metadex.json` at the start of a ChatGPT session.

4. Tell the model something like:

   "This JSON is the canonical ontology and API map for the StashKit/Barback
   architecture (MetaDex get version from the .json file). Use `entities`, `relationships`, and `api.public_methods` as ground truth for architecture and API questions.
   Treat `api.internal_methods` as private."

5. Then proceed directly to development questions; re-teaching the architecture
   and core APIs should not be necessary.
