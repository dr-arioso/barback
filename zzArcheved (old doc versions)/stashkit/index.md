# StashKit: Domain-Neutral Product Framework

StashKit provides the foundation for building inventory systems that need:
- Product identification
- Multi-source enrichment
- Model validation
- Flexible resolution pipelines
- Pluggable data storage
- Typed collections

StashKit is *generic* and intentionally avoids most domain-specific assumptions. It knows about `Item` and `Product` objects, common attributes like UPC, and resolution skills that are widely applicable across commercial product domains.
