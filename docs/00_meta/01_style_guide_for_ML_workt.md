# Style Guide for ML-Generated Developer Summaries
### *Tone, patterns, and examples for maintaining the project's voice*

This file defines how documentation in this project should **sound** when generated by GPT.  
The goal is to create a consistent, lightly wry, developer-friendly voice across all auto‑generated summaries.

---

# 🎤 Core Tone Principles

## 1. **Dry understatement**
Favor a relaxed, knowing voice.  
Avoid enthusiasm explosions.  
Be calm, competent, and slightly amused.

Example:
> “You don’t need to memorize any of this unless you enjoy that sort of thing.”

## 2. **Developer-to-developer respect**
Assume the reader is:
- smart  
- tired  
- impatient  
- curious  
- allergic to fluff  

So give them:
- purpose  
- relevance  
- orientation  

And skip the lecture.

## 3. **Controlled irreverence**
Small winks, not whole comedy routines.

Example:
> “If you're customizing, subclassing, or debugging, this is where the bodies are buried.”

Use sparingly for flavor.

## 4. **Succinct guidance**
Every summary should answer:
- What is this folder?
- Why does it exist?
- When should a dev care?
- What lives here?
- How does it fit into the system?

No more, no less.

# 🧭 Structural Patterns

## For top-level subsystem intros:

Use `00_READ_THIS_FIRST.md` at the subsystem root.

Sections:
- A warm welcome  
- Summary of what the subsystem does  
- Practical “Why this exists”  
- What’s inside  
- Where to go next  

Tone: friendly, inviting, light playfulness.

---

## For deep folders with technical material:

Use `00_DEV_SUMMARY.md`.

Sections:
- Description of what this folder contains  
- Why a developer might come here  
- High-level description of the topics involved  
- Gentle orientation, no deep exposition  

Tone: dry, understated, slightly wry.

# 🪦 If you come up with a good line, use it once

These are “approved flavor enhancers.”  
But don't reuse them multiple times verbatim. You can convey the same ideas with different (but congruent) wording. Tell a good joke once, and it's funny. Immediately tell it again, and people start to wonder if you're drunk. Or an LLM.

- “This is where the bodies are buried.”
- “You don’t need to memorize any of this unless you enjoy that sort of thing.”
- “If you're here, something interesting (or broken) is happening.”
- “Read what you need. Ignore the rest with confidence.”
- “This folder is mostly harmless.”

These help unify voice without overdoing it.

# 🎯 What *Not* To Do

- Don’t belabor jokes.  
- Don’t try to explain the whimsy.  
- Don’t talk down to the reader.  
- Don’t gush (“super awesome!”, “incredible!”).  
- Avoid meta-commentary about the naming inspiration.

Let the style be felt, not announced.

# 📚 When Writing Content That Refers to Childhood Inspirations

Names like **StashDex**, **BoosterPack**, **Skills**, etc. are intentionally evocative.  
Do *not* explain their inspiration unless explicitly asked.

Correct usage:
> “Open a Booster Pack to add new kinds of items or resolver capabilities.”

Incorrect usage:
> “This is like a booster pack from Pokémon — remember those?”

If you know, you know.

# 🔧 Example Mini‑Templates

### Subfolder DEV Summary Template

```
# 00_DEV_SUMMARY.md
### *A developer-friendly orientation for `{folder_name}`*

This folder contains deeper technical material relevant to developers extending or integrating with this subsystem.

You don’t need to memorize any of this unless you enjoy that sort of thing.
But if you're customizing, subclassing, debugging, or trying to understand where certain behaviors come from, this is the right place.

## What’s in this folder
(brief bullet list)

## Guidance
(succinct suggestions)

## How it fits into the system
(why a dev would end up here)
```

### Subsystem Root Template

```
# 00_READ_THIS_FIRST.md
### *A friendly intro to {subsystem_name}*

What this subsystem is for.
Why it exists.
What you get out of the box.
What lives in the folder.
Where to go next.
```

# 🧩 Final Notes

- Follow this guide whenever generating new summaries or structural docs.  
- Keep the voice light, competent, and helpful.  
- If in doubt, choose brevity and dryness over enthusiasm.

This file may grow over time as the project evolves.
