# UI and CLI Integration

Barback exposes:

### CLI
- `barback scan <image>` (vision-based classification)
- `barback upc <code>` (UPC lookup)
- `barback add` (manual entry)

All CLI commands use Barback Pipelines→Resolvers→Skills→Classification Engine.

### UI (future)
- Drag-and-drop bottle identification
- Real-time confidence scoring
- Conflict resolution dialog
- Tag and category browser
