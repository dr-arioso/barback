### *A developer-friendly orientation for `40_barback/04_config`*

This folder contains deeper technical material relevant to developers extending or integrating with this subsystem.

You don’t need to memorize any of this unless you enjoy that sort of thing.
But if you're customizing, subclassing, debugging, or trying to understand where certain behaviors come from, this is the right place.

## What’s in this folder

This directory holds documentation and resources that cover the deeper mechanics, conventions, and reference details for `40_barback/04_config`.

## Guidance

- Skim first; read only what you need.
- Look for anything named `overview`, `architecture`, or `reference` when orienting.
- Dive into specific files only when you're working in that domain.

## How it fits into the system

This folder supports developers who want to:
- extend internal behavior  
- plug into lower-level APIs  
- understand subsystem structure  
- maintain or debug advanced features  

Read selectively. Build boldly.
