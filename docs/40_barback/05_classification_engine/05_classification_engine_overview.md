# Classification Engine Overview

The BoozeDex Classification Engine converts *raw inputs* (e.g., UPC data,
OCR output, AI descriptions, user text) into a structured BoozeDex product
classification.

It performs:

- taxonomy path resolution  
- StashTag inference  
- conflict reconciliation  
- confidence scoring  
- provenance tracking  

This subsystem is central to Barback's automated bottle identification.
