# Barback CLI & UI Integration — Overview

Barback provides both command-line tools and optional GUI components.
Both interfaces sit on top of the same internal engine:

Skills → Resolvers → Pipelines → Classification Engine → Persistence

The CLI serves developers, power users, and automation workflows.
The UI (planned) serves casual users, mobile users, and field inventory tasks.

This subsystem describes how external interfaces connect to Barback’s core logic.
