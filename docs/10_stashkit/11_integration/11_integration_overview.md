# Integration Subsystem Overview

The **Integration subsystem** documents how StashKit components work in external
environments and how external systems integrate with StashKit.

Integrations typically address:

- UI frameworks (Tkinter, PySide, web frontends)
- CLI tools and automation
- External APIs (Vision, Product Databases, GS1, ingredient databases)
- Hosting StashKit-backed services
- Embedding StashKit in larger Python applications

This subsystem is a guide for real‑world deployment of StashKit.
