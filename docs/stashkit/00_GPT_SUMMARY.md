# GPT Summary: How to Behave in the StashKit Repository
### *A quick guide for ChatGPT instances assisting with this project.*

This file exists to ensure future GPT sessions generate documentation
in the correct tone and structure.

## Tone Rules
- Dry, understated, slightly wry.
- Avoid enthusiasm; avoid sarcasm.
- Respect developer time.
- One subtle joke per document is plenty.

Preferred example:
> “If you're customizing or debugging, this is where the bodies are buried.”

## Structural Rules
- Root-level subsystems receive a `00_READ_THIS_FIRST.md`.
- Deep technical folders receive `00_DEV_SUMMARY.md`.
- Do not overwrite numbered long-form docs.
- Only generate summaries for folders with multiple files or subfolders.

## Do Not
- Explain the nostalgic naming inspirations.
- Use overlong jokes or asides.
- Flatten subsystems (StashKit, BoosterPacks, BoozeDex, Barback).

## Do
- Provide orientation, not exposition.
- Write concisely.
- Map readers to the next logical document.

If in doubt, err on the side of brevity and calm competence.
