# Booster Pack Templates Overview

Templates provide reusable starting points for Booster Pack authors.
They ensure new packs follow best practices for structure, schema
organization, DexTree definitions, StashTags, Skills, Resolvers,
Pipelines, and runtime loaders.

Templates also help maintain compatibility across StashKit upgrades.
