# Overlay Authoring Guidelines

### 1. Keep overlay tags human-readable
Tags should be intuitive for bartenders and consumers.

### 2. Avoid duplicating taxonomy information
If it describes *physical categorization*, it belongs in DexTree.  
If it describes *usage, flavor, or function*, it belongs in overlays.

### 3. Prefer flat structures unless hierarchy adds meaning
Flavor profiles may have hierarchy; cocktail roles generally do not.

### 4. Tags should be broad enough to be re-used
"Aperitif" is useful.  
"Thanksgiving Aperitif Limited Edition 2022" is not.

### 5. Avoid conflating brand with role
Brand-specific tags should not exist in domain packs.
