# BoozeDex Overlays Overview

Overlays provide *polyhierarchical meaning* without breaking the strict
hierarchical structure of the taxonomy (DexTree).  
They allow any product or node to have multiple additional classifications,
functional roles, or relationships.

BoozeDex uses overlays exclusively for:
- cocktail roles
- flavor profiles
- usage roles (aperitif, digestif, etc.)
- production method tags
- contextual metadata (holiday drinks, seasonal, etc.)

Overlays are implemented as **StashTags**, keeping the taxonomy clean and stable.
