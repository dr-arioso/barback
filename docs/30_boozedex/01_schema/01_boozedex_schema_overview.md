# BoozeDex Schema Overview

BoozeDex is the canonical beverage-domain Booster Pack for StashKit.  
It defines the schema standards for:

- Taxonomy (DexTree)
- StashTags (flavor, roles, characteristics)
- Standardized beverage fields (ABV, volume, style, origin)
- Category definitions and constraints

The goal is to provide a clean, extensible, authoritative structure for describing
all beverage-domain products consistently across tools and applications.
