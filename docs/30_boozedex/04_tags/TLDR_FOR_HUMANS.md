# 00_DEV_SUMMARY.md  
### *A developer-friendly orientation for `30_boozedex/04_tags`*

This folder contains a concentrated set of documents that go into the deep details of StashKit’s architecture and behavior.

You don’t need to memorize any of this unless you enjoy that sort of thing. But if you're customizing, subclassing, debugging, or extending the system, this is where the important details live.

## What’s in this folder

This directory includes:
- 7 files
- 0 subfolders

It covers topics such as:
- internal mechanics
- extension points
- conventions
- testing strategies
- architecture details
- advanced subsystem behavior

If you're building custom resolvers, packs, pipeline stages, or taxonomy layers, this is where you’ll find reference material and patterns worth following.

## Guidance

Read selectively:
- Start with anything labeled `overview`, `architecture`, or `extension`.
- Dip into deeper files only when you're working in that space.
- Don’t feel obligated to understand every corner before building something.

## How it fits into the system

This folder serves as a foundation for developers who want to:
- implement deeper extensions  
- follow project conventions  
- understand how the subsystem interacts with the rest of StashKit  
- troubleshoot or customize system behavior  

Feel free to jump straight to building. Come back here when you want to know how the pieces fit behind the curtain.
