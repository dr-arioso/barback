# BoozeDex StashTags Overview

StashTags are the metadata layer that enables BoozeDex to express rich
relationships beyond strict taxonomy.  
They represent:

- functional roles  
- flavor notes  
- production attributes  
- contextual usage  
- cross-cutting properties  

Unlike the taxonomy (DexTree), tagsets are **polyhierarchical**, **multi-valued**, and
**optional**, giving BoozeDex its expressive power.
