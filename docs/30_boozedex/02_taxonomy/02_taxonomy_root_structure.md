# Root-Level Structure

BoozeDex uses the following canonical root nodes:

```
root:
  spirits:
  wine:
  beer:
  cider:
  liqueurs:
  mixers:
  non_alcoholic:
```

Rationale:
- Aligns with both industry practice and legal categories
- Keeps user-facing UI intuitive (bartender mental model)
- Avoids overly granular or legalistic categories at the root
