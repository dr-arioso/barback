# BoozeDex Taxonomy Overview

The BoozeDex taxonomy (DexTree) provides a structured, hierarchical classification
system for all beverage-domain products.

It is designed to be:

- **authoritative** (aligned with TTB + industry standards)
- **human-editable** (YAML-based)
- **machine-efficient** (compiled to JSON DexTree)
- **polyhierarchical-ready** (via StashTags overlays)
- **resilient** (self-validated during build)

The taxonomy separates *physical categories* (spirits, wine, beer, mixers)
from *functional roles* (aperitif, digestif, base spirit, modifier) handled via tags.
