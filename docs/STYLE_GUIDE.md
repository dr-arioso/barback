# Project Style Guide
### Writing Documentation with the Right Voice

This style guide is for humans contributing to the StashKit + Barback documentation.
It summarizes the tone, voice, and practices used throughout the project.

## Tone
- Dry, understated confidence  
- Helpful without lecturing  
- Light touch of irreverence  
- Respectful of developer time  

## Voice
- Assume the reader is smart, tired, and curious.  
- Use clear, direct sentences.  
- Add small wry comments only when useful.  
- Avoid over-explaining jokes or naming choices.

## Examples of Good Tone
> “You don’t need to memorize any of this unless you enjoy that sort of thing.”

> “If you're customizing or debugging, this is where the bodies are buried.”

These land because they acknowledge developer reality without being cute.

## Structure of Docs
- Each major folder gets a `00_READ_THIS_FIRST.md` (friendly summary).
- Deep or complex folders get a `00_DEV_SUMMARY.md` (developer orientation).
- Longer technical docs remain in their existing numbered files.

## What to Avoid
- Overly cheerful writing  
- Exclamation points  
- Trying too hard to be funny  
- Explaining the nostalgia behind names  
- Apologizing for complexity  

## Guiding Principles
- Clarity beats cleverness  
- Brevity beats thoroughness  
- Orientation beats exposition
