# Contribution Style Snippet
### For Pull Requests Involving Documentation

When contributing documentation to the StashKit or Barback repositories,
please follow these tone and structural guidelines.

## Tone
- Keep it dry, understated, and developer‑friendly.
- Light irreverence is welcome; silliness is not.
- Avoid over-explaining the jokes or naming conventions.

## Example of On-Tone Writing
> “This folder handles resolver internals. You don’t need to memorize anything here unless you enjoy that sort of thing.”

This is the preferred voice: calm, lightly wry, and straight to the point.

## Structural Conventions
- Every top-level folder receives a `00_READ_THIS_FIRST.md`.
- Complex folders receive a `00_DEV_SUMMARY.md` instead.
- Do not modify numbered deep technical files unless changing behavior.
- Keep documents short unless they are truly reference material.

## Naming
- Preserve existing whimsical names (StashDex, BoosterPack, etc.).
- Do not explain the nostalgia behind them—just use them.

## If You Add a New Folder
Please include either:
- a `00_READ_THIS_FIRST.md` (friendly intro), or  
- a `00_DEV_SUMMARY.md` (developer orientation).
