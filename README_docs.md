# Barback Documentation Overview

This document provides a high-level guide to the documentation structure for the Barback project.

## Structure

- **architecture.md** — Detailed system architecture, data flow, and component responsibilities.
- **stashkit_api.md** — Documentation of the planned StashKit API abstractions and integration points.
- **roadmap.md** — Short-term and long-term development roadmap.
- **style.css** — A simple clean stylesheet for rendering local HTML exports.
- **glossary.md** — Definitions of key concepts and terminology used in the project.

## Goals

- Provide clear separation between Barback (the CLI tool) and StashKit (the resolver/output engine).
- Support future expansion such as HTML report generation, parallel output formats, cloud resolver plugins, etc.
