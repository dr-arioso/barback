# Barback & StashKit

Barback is an intelligent home-bar inventory system built on top of **StashKit**, a generic ingestion and item-normalization framework.

This documentation set is designed so that you can rebuild the project from scratch, understand the architecture, and extend it for new domains.

Key documents:

- `STATE_OF_PROJECT.md` — high-level goals and current direction
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — overall structure and design principles (with diagrams)
- `STASHKIT.md` — framework-level API and concepts
- `BARBACK.md` — Barback-specific structures and flows
- `DEV_GUIDE.md` — onboarding and development workflows
- `EXAMPLES.md` — concrete code examples and recipes
